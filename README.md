##  Description of the program

  1.  The code implement 3 different type scheduling (FCFS, RR, SRTF). The command line argument wil be 
	Name of the input file, scheduling algorithm and quantumsize (for RR algorithm).	
	it will print the gnatt chart and a table with pid, arrival, cpu-burst, finish, wait time, turn 	
	around time and # of context, then it will calculate the avg burst time, avg waiting time, avg 
	turn around time and number of context
